The illustrious Psychedelic Circus crew takes this approach very serious year after year and therefore presents the first 3D festival in northern Europe this time. The entire decoration and projection concept is designed for producing a one of a kind optical depth when watched through special glasses.\nOf course there will be also impressing depths in a musical respect. Based on a distinctly psychedelic focus, the lineup delivers varied inspirations for frisky acrobatics on the two dance floors, names like Freakshow, DNA, Tristan, Sven Snug or Symphonix might speak for themselves."

Indian Spirit festival provides an excellent setting for this experience, which again might be the reason why it became the grand finale of the famous North-East open air season.\nIndian Spirit is always good for a pleasant surprise and some next-level psychedelic entertainment. As the first Psytrance festival in Germany, it introduced Funktion One sound systems on all dance floors. Also a special 3D decoration concept that provides a mind-bending impression of depth. Looking at the promoters gives some illuminating insights into the innovative character of IndianGerman Spirit: Besides original organizer DJ Syncron, there are the Symphonix brothers, formerly responsible for Tshitraka festival, and Mr. Vaishiyas of SpinTwist Records."

In non-hierarchical group experiences, interventions in public space, and performative and discursive rituals, vehement visual, sonic, and vocal indictments against a world of exclusion, eradication, and destruction converge with utopian counter models for society beyond all obsolete dualistic thought and action schemes. This utopia of a new world conception in the realm of the performative arts is also reflected in the rendering of a radically new soundscape that spans from experimental electronic innovations between ambient and techno to audio-visual premieres, new band and club formats, sound art, and installations."

It is an initiation into the dance trance and a new door into another dimension with a constructive intuitive intention: to expand human consciousness and the relation between the soul, the body, and its center of power. Transition comes from latin (?tránsito?): change of position, estate, or concept to another.The Transition experience takes a whole week in the forest, guided by the Spirits of Nature with love and passion. Camp in a priviledge area in the Andalusian forest with your friends and save some amazing days full of magic, love, and tribal celebration. The MAIN FLOOR pushes to all participants (even the crew) to an ego disolution, helping to discover the proper place where each of us is blocked in our lives. It is open to all kind of public, but specially to people really interested in their spiritual growth and human development. Transition Festival is an actual underground rave coming from a free party in 2007 under a total full moon eclipse. The result is a ?temporary autonomous zone? (TAZ) in the middle of the forest. The guests for Transition 2017 will be published in the precise moment of the full moon before the Spring Equinox, the 12th March 2017. The complete timetable will be online just a few days before the festival. Have a look at the past editions líne ups for you to have an idea of what is waiting for you in the forest.LOVE is the topic for next edition in 2017, completing the cycle of 4 years (Peace, Love, Unity, and Respect). Together we dance to change our behaviour, it is time for the rebirth of love: compassion. The transformational psychedelic experience is what we call TRANSITION. We must detach from our conditioned reality to guide our actions towards the paradise we are constructing for ourselves. Nothing is wasted, there are no judgements? hard moments will bring us to touch heaven, so fear must be given away to give space for the Spirit, and Love. The connection with the shammans is all we need to keep learning and growing together. Make Your Transition !!!"
